# Transfer-Learning
This project performs a demonstration of a machine learning concept called transfer learning, where knowledge gained while solving one task is applied another related task.

## Implementation
In this example we use the mobile net model architecture and ImageNet image dataset. 
A few top layers are added and the model is retrained to fit our task of classifying cattle breeds.
